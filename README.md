_Five Nights at Freddy's_, sometimes referred to as FNAF, is an **indie horror** video game series that was created by Scott Cawthon in 2014. Players usually play as an overnight security guard at one of the restaurants in the _Fazbear Entertainment_ chain, beginning at "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza" in the first game. The original concept for the game, which is the origin of the game's name, is to survive five nights on the job. Throughout the games, players have to defend themselves against the animatronic characters at each location.
